### General Information

In this project, we set up a data warehouse and data lake system using AWS in the scope of the HSLU M.Sc. in Applied Information and Data Science course. 
The scope is about extracting historical weather and aviation data, training a model which predicts cancellations based on extreme weather events and using this model 
to rpedict future cancellations and delays based on airport locations.
